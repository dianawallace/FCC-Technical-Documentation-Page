        <p>CSS Animations is a module of CSS that lets you animate the values of CSS properties over time, using keyframes. 
        The behavior of these keyframe animations can be controlled by specifying their timing function, duration, their number of repetitions, and other attributes.</p>
        <p>CSS Animations make it possible to do incredible things with the elements that make up your documents and apps. 
        However, there are things you might want to do that aren't obvious, or clever ways to do things that you might not come up with right away. 
        This article is a collection of tips and tricks we've found that may make your work easier, including how to run a stopped animation again.</p>
        <p>There are three key advantages to CSS animations over traditional script-driven animation techniques:</p>
        <p>They’re easy to use for simple animations; you can create them without even having to know JavaScript.</p>
        <p>The animations run well, even under moderate system load. Simple animations can often perform poorly in JavaScript (unless they’re well made). 
        The rendering engine can use frame-skipping and other techniques to keep the performance as smooth as possible.</p>
        <p>Letting the browser control the animation sequence lets the browser optimize performance and efficiency by, for example, 
        reducing the update frequency of animations running in tabs that aren't currently visible.</p>
        <p>The sub-properties of the animation property are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Animation Name</li>
            <li>Animation Delay</li>
            <li>Animation Direction</li>
            <li>Animation Duration</li>
            <li>Animation Fill Mode</li>
          </ul>
    </section>
    
      <!--Animation-Name Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="Animation-Name">
      <header>Animation Name</header>
      <p>The animation-name CSS property sets one or more animations to apply to an element. 
      Each name is an @keyframes at-rule that sets the property values for the animation sequence.</p>
      <p>A special keyword denoting no keyframes. It can be used to deactivate an animation without 
      changing the ordering of the other identifiers, or to deactivate animations coming from the cascade.</p>
      
      <code>/* Single animation */
        animation-name: none;
        animation-name: test_05;
        animation-name: -specific;
        animation-name: sliding-vertically;</code>

        <code>/* Multiple animations */
        animation-name: test1, animation4;
        animation-name: none, -moz-specific, sliding;</code>
    </section>
      
      <!--Animation Delay Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="Animation-Delay">
      <header>Animation Delay</header>
        <p>The animation-delay CSS property sets when an animation starts. 
        The animation can start later, immediately from its beginning, or immediately and partway through the animation.</p>
        <p>It is often convenient to use the shorthand property animation to set all animation properties at once.</p>
        <code>/* Single animation */
animation-delay: 3s;
animation-delay: 0s;
animation-delay: -1500ms;

/* Multiple animations */
animation-delay: 2.1s, 480ms;</code>
    </section>
    
      <!--Animation Direction Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="Animation_Direction">
      <header>Animation Direction</header>
        <p>The animation-direction CSS property sets whether an animation should play forwards, backwards, or alternating back and forth.</p>
        <p>It is often convenient to use the shorthand property animation to set all animation properties at once.</p>
        <code>/* Single animation */
animation-direction: normal;
animation-direction: reverse;
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-direction: alternate-reverse;

/* Multiple animations */
animation-direction: normal, reverse;
animation-direction: alternate, reverse, normal;

/* Global values */
animation-direction: inherit;
animation-direction: initial;
animation-direction: unset;</code>
    </section>
    
      <!--Animation Duration Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="Animation-Duration">
      <header>Animation Duration</header>
      <p>The animation-duration CSS property sets the length of time that an animation takes to complete one cycle.</p>
      <p>It is often convenient to use the shorthand property animation to set all animation properties at once.</p>
      <code>/* Single animation */
animation-duration: 6s;
animation-duration: 120ms;

/* Multiple animations */
animation-duration: 1.64s, 15.22s;
animation-duration: 10s, 35s, 230ms;</code>
    </section>
    
      <!--Animation Fill Mode Section-->
    <section class="main-section" id="Animation_Fill_Mode">
      <header>Animation Fill Mode</header>
        <p>The animation-fill-mode CSS property sets how a CSS animation applies styles to its target before and after its execution.</p>
        <p>It is often convenient to use the shorthand property animation to set all animation properties at once.</p>
        <code>/* Single animation */
animation-fill-mode: none;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
animation-fill-mode: backwards;
animation-fill-mode: both;

/* Multiple animations */
animation-fill-mode: none, backwards;
animation-fill-mode: both, forwards, none;</code>
